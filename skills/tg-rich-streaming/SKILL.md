# tg-rich-streaming

Stream AI-generated text into a Telegram private chat with native draft animation and a "thinking" indicator — the same UX as ChatGPT or Claude, directly inside the bot.

Sending requires network access to `api.telegram.org` and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
`sendRichMessageDraft` works only with a private integer `chat_id`. Bot API 10.2 also permits
direct `InputRichMessage.blocks`; the draft lifecycle below is unchanged.

## Core pattern

Four mandatory steps. Skip step 3 and the draft disappears after ~30 seconds.

### Step 1 — open draft with Thinking block

Send the first `sendRichMessageDraft` immediately after the LLM call starts.
`draft_id` is any non-zero integer you generate once per response; keep it for all updates.
`RichBlockThinking` signals the model is working.

```
POST /sendRichMessageDraft
{
  "chat_id": <integer>,          // private chat only — no @username
  "draft_id": 42,
  "rich_message": {
    "markdown": "<tg-thinking>Thinking…</tg-thinking>"
  }
}
```

> Rich HTML tags (like `<tg-thinking>`) are valid pass-through inside the `markdown` field — spec explicitly allows HTML tags in Rich Markdown.

> `RichBlockThinking` is **only** valid in `sendRichMessageDraft`. It is never stored in a `Message`.

### Step 2 — update draft as tokens arrive

Call `sendRichMessageDraft` again with the **same `draft_id`** each time you have enough new text. The client animates the transition.

**Throttle**: send at most once every 1–2 seconds. The draft is ephemeral (~30 s window) — keep sending updates or move to step 3 before the window closes.

Drop the Thinking block from the first update that contains real content.

```
# pseudocode — generic async LLM stream

draft_id = generate_nonzero_id()
accumulated = ""
last_sent = 0

send_draft(chat_id, draft_id, thinking_markdown())   # step 1

for chunk in llm.stream(prompt):
    accumulated += chunk.text
    now = time.monotonic()
    if now - last_sent >= 1.5:                        # throttle
        send_draft(chat_id, draft_id, accumulated)
        last_sent = now

finalize(chat_id, accumulated)                        # step 3 — mandatory
```

### Step 3 — finalize with sendRichMessage (mandatory)

After the LLM stream ends, call `sendRichMessage`. This creates the **permanent** message. If you skip this, the draft vanishes.

```
POST /sendRichMessage
{
  "chat_id": <integer>,
  "rich_message": {
    "markdown": "<full generated text>"
  }
}
```

### Step 4 — edits after finalization

Use `editMessageText` with the `rich_message` parameter to update the permanent message later (corrections, appended content, etc.).

```
POST /editMessageText
{
  "chat_id": <integer>,
  "message_id": <id from step 3 response>,
  "rich_message": {
    "markdown": "<revised text>"
  }
}
```

> `text` and `rich_message` are mutually exclusive in `editMessageText` — use exactly one.

## Pitfalls

| Trap | What happens | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Skipped `sendRichMessage` after stream ends | Draft disappears after ~30 s, no permanent message | Always call `sendRichMessage` with full text as last step |
| `chat_id` is a String or `@username` | `sendRichMessageDraft` returns error | Only Integer chat_id supported for drafts; fall back to `sendMessage` + `editMessageText` in groups/channels |
| Sending a draft update every token | Flood / rate limit, poor animation | Batch tokens, send at most every 1–2 s |
| `RichBlockThinking` in `sendRichMessage` | Not stored in Message; spec prohibits it | Remove Thinking block before finalization |
| Partial Markdown mid-stream | Unclosed `` ``` `` or `**` renders broken | Either send complete blocks only, or use raw text during streaming and apply Markdown only at finalization |
| 30-second window expires mid-stream | Draft gone | If stream is slow, send a keep-alive draft update (even unchanged text) before the window closes |

## Group / channel fallback

`sendRichMessageDraft` is private-chat only. For groups and channels:

1. Send initial `sendMessage` with `"⌛ Generating…"` placeholder.
2. Edit with `editMessageText` (rich_message) when done.

No real-time animation, but the final message is rich-formatted.

## Request reference

```
sendRichMessageDraft  POST /bot<TOKEN>/sendRichMessageDraft
  chat_id        Integer   required — private chat only
  draft_id       Integer   required — non-zero; same id = animated update
  rich_message   InputRichMessage   required

sendRichMessage       POST /bot<TOKEN>/sendRichMessage
  chat_id        Integer or String   required
  rich_message   InputRichMessage    required
  → returns Message (use .message_id for edits)

editMessageText       POST /bot<TOKEN>/editMessageText
  chat_id        Integer or String
  message_id     Integer
  rich_message   InputRichMessage    (mutually exclusive with "text")
```

`InputRichMessage` fields: exactly one of `html` or `markdown`, optional `is_rtl`, optional `skip_entity_detection`.
